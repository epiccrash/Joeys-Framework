# Joey's Framework
This is a framework of simple boilerplate components for Unity, intended for easy reuse throughout different projects.

This project has three design pillars:
- Create small, atomic, and modular components.
- Keep components as straightforward as possible.
- Make components work at their most basic implementation.

Components will be fully documented in code and (eventually) in the wiki. Each component will also have at least one basic example scene so users can see how it works.

Please note that this repository is a continuous work in progress, as well as a passion project and hobby maintained by one intermediately-skilled Unity developer. As such, I always prioritize what I'm interested in at any given time, and things might take awhile :)
